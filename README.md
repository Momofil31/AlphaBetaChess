# AlphaBetaChess

This project is a ~~very~~ simple implementation of the Alpha-Beta pruning search algorithm on the game of chess.

I was studying the chapter on Adversarial Search on
the [AIMA book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach) and this particular algorithm
wasn't really clear to me at the beginning. So, in order to dig more deeply into the topic and to practice my Python
skills I tried to implement it.

I used [`python-chess`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.0/) library to do all the chess related stuff like
calculating legal moves, checkmates, etc. If you want to run this project that library is required:

```
pip install chess
```

### TODO:

- [ ] Write an explanation of the algorithm in this readme.md
